# Julia Evans's thing for publishing an HTML page

SOURCE: https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/09/06/how-to-put-an-html-page-on-the-internet/

One thing I love about the internet is that it’s SO EASY to put static HTML
websites on the internet. Someone asked me today how to do it, so I thought
I’d write down how really quickly!

## just an HTML page

All of my sites are just static HTML and CSS. My web design skills are relatively minimal
(https://wizardzines.com is the most complicated site I’ve developed on my own), so keeping
all my internet sites relatively simple means that I have some hope of being able to make
changes / fix things without spending a billion hours on it.

So we’re going to take as minimal of an approach as possible in this blog post – just one HTML page.

## the HTML page

The website we’re going to put on the internet is just one file, called index.html. You can find
it at https://github.com/jvns/website-example, which is a Github repository with exactly one file in it.

The HTML file has some CSS in it to make it look a little less boring, which is partly copied
from https://example.com.

## how to put the HTML page on the internet
Here are the steps:

1. sign up for a Neocities account
1. copy the index.html into the index.html in your neocities site
1. done

The index.html page above is on the internet at julia-example-website.neocities.com, if you view
source you’ll see that it’s the same HTML as in the github repo.

I think this is probably the simplest way to put an HTML page on the internet (and it’s a
throwback to Geocities, which is how I made my first website in 2003) :). I also like that
Neocities (like glitch, which I also love) is about experimentation and learning and having fun..

## other options

This is definitely not the only easy way – Github pages and Gitlab pages and Netlify will
all automatically publish a site when you push to a Git repository, and they’re all very
easy to use (just connect them to your github repository and you’re done). I personally
use the Git repository approach because not having things in Git makes me nervous – I like
to know what changes to my website I’m actually pushing. But I think if you just want to
put an HTML site on the internet for the first time and play around with HTML/CSS, Neocities
is a really nice way to do it.

If you want to actually use your website for a Real Thing and not just to play around
you probably want to buy a domain and link it to your website so that you can change
hosting providers in the future, but that is a bit less simple.

## this is a good possible jumping off point for learning HTML

If you are a person who is comfortable editing files in a Git repository but wants to
practice HTML/CSS, I think this is a fun way to put a website on the internet and
play around! I really like the simplicity of it – there’s literally just one file,
so there’s no fancy extra magic to get in the way of understanding what’s going on.

There are also a bunch of ways to complicate/extend this, like this blog is actually
generated with Hugo which generates a bunch of HTML files which then go on the
internet, but it’s always nice to start with the basics.
